React-> is JS Library used to create UI.
     -> it is all about component -> reusable piece of code we can call it function.
     -> It create custom HTML element -> just for our understanding
we can do everything that react do we can do by JS.
Why React-> JS used imperative approach->means we have to do things step by step
                                       ->More Number of lines we have to write in JS.
                                       ->more code,more detailing

        ->in react we only used to write the end state.
        ->easy to create UI than by JS.
generally React use declarative approach which is opposite to imperative approach.
SPA(Single Page Application) Approach-> here in single HTML file we do all changes dynamically.

React Alternatives->Angular,VUI.

Component->  peace of code 
         ->   why component in react-> Reusability,Do not Repeat Yourself(DRY),Readbility,Maintainability,etc

Steps to create new SPA :
step 1 -> Install node JS
step 2 -> VS code
step 3 -> Create a new folder -> Reactfolio
step 4 -> Change directory to react folio
step 5 -> npx create-react-app demoshopapp
step 6 -> changes directory to demoshopapp
step 7 -> npm start

things to see first in React
 ->package.json->dependencies/script/version
 ->SRC->app.js
      ->index.css
      ->index.js
->public->index.html->'root element is presene'->no need to do any change here
->node-module->packges instal karte hai by npm start

flow in react
1.index.js->it executes file first and root create with the help of index.html
2.through app.Js it render root and then render component by app.js
3.render Html code present in app.js
